# TinyGPT Shakespeare Text Generation 🎭  

This is my learning project where I trained **TinyGPT** on the **Shakespeare dataset** using **PyTorch**.  
My goal was to understand how transformers work in practice and explore how small language models can be trained from scratch.

## 🌟 Project Motivation  

I have been curious about how text generation models like GPT actually work under the hood. Instead of just using pre-trained models, I wanted to try training one myself on a classical dataset — Shakespeare’s works.  

This project is not about state-of-the-art results but about **learning, experimenting, and building intuition** about deep learning and NLP.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

- **Framework**: PyTorch 🐍  
- **Model**: TinyGPT (a minimal GPT implementation)  
- **Dataset**: Shakespeare dataset (`input.txt`)  
- **Task**: Text generation + experimenting with chatbot-like interactions(can be done if finetuned in future with Q/A prompt post- training)
